## Hi there, I'm Rangerr 👋

### 🚀 Aspiring Software Engineer | CS Student @ Open University

I'm a freshman exploring the world of Computer Science. I might be a **newbie** right now, but I'm on my way to mastering C++.

- 🔭 I’m currently studying at **Open University (Vietnam)**.
- 🌱 I’m focusing on **C++**, **OOP**, and **Data Structures**.
- 🤝 I’m looking for help with **Advanced C++ techniques**.
- ⚡ **Personality:** I usually run on "Low Power Mode", but when I find a bug or a project I love, I lock in until it's done! 💻
